Frontend Code Challenge

Summary

This coding challenge requires you to create a UI module based on design
specifications. This is not a pass or fail challenge. We simply want to see what you are
capable of. Your submission is evaluated on the following:

Criteria

•	Coding standards

•	Object-oriented design principals

•	Efficiency / scalability

•	Practicality


Instructions:

1.)	Using Angular 2, create the module described by this spec sheet:
http://adobe.ly/24noOTP 

2.)	Page should take in arguments in the route name to update the API call for various locations (for example, Kansas City, MO; Orlando, FL; or New York, NY).

3.)	This project can use any library you would like with the exception that you must use Font Awesome for the icons. 
https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.6.3/css/font-awesome.min.css   

Note: not all icons from design spec can be found in font-awesome, so use a best guess replacement in these cases.

4.)	Match the provided spec as closely as possible. Responsive design not
mandated, but if you want to show off, feel free.

5.)	Use this API call for data: 
http://prod-joyfulhome-api.synapsys.us/location/amenitiesInLocation/[State Abbreviation]/[City Name]
ie:
http://prod-joyfulhome-api.synapsys.us/location/amenitiesInLocation/CA/San%20Francisco

6.)	The left/right carousel buttons should cycle through the items in the restaurant
list. The top/down arrows do not need to be functional.

7.)	The number of nearby listings under each category should use the data from the
API call.

8.)	Clicking one of the three square tiles on the right should update the list in the
carousel slider.

9.)	Upload your solution to your GitHub repository and send us the link.

*Bonus points

•	Create a separate page that geo-locates the webpage to the user’s location.

•	Add hover state/animations of your choosing to the various buttons/items.
